|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**        | Sketch constructor edges for the Northstar CRM bean graph    |
| **Skills practiced** | Bean graph sketching                                         |
| **Expected outcome** | notes/bean-graph-sketch.md                                   |
| **Estimated time**   | 10–12 minutes                                                |
| **File to create**   | `examples/module-22-exercises/` → notes/bean-graph-sketch.md |
| **Checkpoint**       | E (after slides 29–31)                                       |

## What you will learn

- Controller → CustomerService
- CustomerService → CustomerRepository + NotificationService
- Edges must match constructors for the lab doc

**Enterprise context:** Reviewers reject mystery wiring — dependency-graph.md must match real constructors.

## Deliverable

**Submit only** the file (s) below (not the graded lab).

| Item            | Path (under `examples/module-22-exercises/`) |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Your notes file | `notes/bean-graph-sketch.md`                 |

## Worked example (read first)

Here is the shape of a complete answer for this exercise. Adapt the content — do not leave blanks.

```markdown
# Lab 22 — Bean Graph Skeleton

CustomerController → CustomerService
CustomerService → CustomerRepository
CustomerService → NotificationService
(optional) CustomerService → CustomerMetrics if present from Lab 21

Unit test: construct CustomerService with fakes — no Spring required.

## Scope
Pre-lab only.
```

Then follow **Steps** to create your own file.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Create the notes file

From `examples/module-22-exercises/`, create `notes/` if needed, then create `notes/bean-graph-sketch.md`.

### Step 2 — Paste and complete this template

```markdown
# Lab 22 — Bean Graph Skeleton

## Edges (fill TODOs)
CustomerController → _____
CustomerService → _____
CustomerService → _____
Optional metrics edge: _____

## Unit-test construction (one line)
_____

## Scope
Pre-lab only.
```

### Step 3 — Self-check

Confirm fixtures if used: Amina `CUS-1001`/`ACTIVE`, Ravi `CUS-1002`/`PROSPECT`, correlation `lab-request-001`. Replace
every `_____` before Pass.

## Expected result

Bean graph sketch in `notes/bean-graph-sketch.md`.

## Debug / design challenge

If NotificationService also depended on CustomerService, what problem appears?

## Predict the Output / Behavior

Does the graph include `new` edges inside CustomerService after IoC refactor?

## Troubleshooting

### If it fails

| Problem               | Fix                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| No file / wrong name  | Must be `notes/bean-graph-sketch.md` |
| Missing notifier edge | Service → NotificationService        |
| Keeping new edges     | Remove them after IoC                |

## Pass criteria

Self-check before marking Pass:

- [ ] File exists at `notes/bean-graph-sketch.md`
- [ ] Controller→Service
- [ ] Service→Repo
- [ ] Service→Notifier
