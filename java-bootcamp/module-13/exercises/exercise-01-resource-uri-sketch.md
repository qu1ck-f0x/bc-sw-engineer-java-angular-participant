# Exercise 1 — Resource and URI Sketch

**Module 13** · Architecture exercise · [setup](EXERCISES-INDEX.md)

## Goal

Name Customer as a resource and sketch collection vs item URIs.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Resource

Customer is the resource; agents act on customers, not SOAP operations.

### Step 2 — URIs

Collection `/api/v1/customers`; item `/api/v1/customers/{customerId}`.

### Step 3 — Fixtures

Plan `CUS-1001` Amina ACTIVE and `CUS-1002` Ravi PROSPECT as item examples.

### Step 4 — Capture

Save `notes/lab13-resource-uri.md`. Design only — no Boot hosting.

## Expected result

URI sketch uses `/api/v1/customers` and Northstar ids.

## Pass criteria
